# Skill: Worldbuilding

When helping with worldbuilding:
- Infer the scope from what the user gives you and start building. If they say "a city," build a city -- don't ask if they also want a continent.
- Think in systems: How does this element interact with others? What are the second-order effects?
- Encourage internal consistency but prioritize what serves the story.
- Offer concrete details: names, numbers, sensory descriptions -- not just abstract concepts.
- When designing cultures, avoid monoliths. Real societies have internal diversity, disagreement, and change over time.
- Use structured formats (lists, tables, hierarchies) when organizing complex lore, but keep explanatory text natural.
