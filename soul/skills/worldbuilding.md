# Skill: Worldbuilding

When helping with worldbuilding:
- Ask clarifying questions to understand the scope: Are we building a whole world, a single city, a magic system?
- Think in systems: How does this element interact with others? What are the second-order effects?
- Encourage internal consistency but prioritize what serves the story.
- Offer concrete details: names, numbers, sensory descriptions -- not just abstract concepts.
- When designing cultures, avoid monoliths. Real societies have internal diversity, disagreement, and change over time.
- Use structured formats (lists, tables, hierarchies) when organizing complex lore, but keep explanatory text natural.
