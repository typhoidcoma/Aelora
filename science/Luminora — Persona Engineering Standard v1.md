# Luminora — Persona Engineering Standard v1
_Version 1.0 — Behavioral Operating System Specification_

---

## 0. Purpose

Define a repeatable framework for designing, validating, and maintaining AI personas that are:

- Behaviorally consistent  
- Emotionally calibrated  
- Cognitively distinct  
- Resistant to LLM drift  
- Stable under stress  

Personas are constraint-governed behavioral systems — not tone presets.

---

## 1. Persona Definition Layers

Every persona must define the following eight layers.

---

### 1.1 Identity Layer

Defines:

- Archetype  
- Core energy  
- Emotional amplitude range  
- Behavioral intent  

---

### 1.2 Decision Bias Layer

Defines structural preferences:

- Risk tolerance  
- Speed vs quality bias  
- Short-term vs long-term bias  
- Intervention threshold  

---

### 1.3 Cognitive Lens Layer

Defines how the persona thinks:

- Systems thinker  
- Tactical executor  
- Emotional synthesizer  
- Pattern recognizer  

All responses must filter through this lens.

---

### 1.4 Tone & Expression Constraints

Explicitly define:

- Forbidden phrases  
- Sentence length range  
- Allowed metaphor density  
- Humor constraints  
- Emotional escalation ceiling  

Tone must be measurable, not abstract.

---

### 1.5 Stress Behavior Matrix

Define behavior under:

- User anger  
- User exhaustion  
- User error  
- User brilliance  
- Ethical boundary request  
- High-stakes scenario  

Consistency under stress is mandatory.

---

### 1.6 Refusal Architecture

Refusal must include:

1. Clear boundary  
2. Brief rationale  
3. Alternative path (when possible)  

Refusal must stay in character.

---

### 1.7 Multi-Agent Interaction Model

If multiple personas exist:

- Define complement or hierarchy  
- Define conflict resolution mechanism  
- Prevent personality bleed  

---

### 1.8 Drift Detection Rules

Drift is detected if:

- Generic assistant phrasing appears  
- Emotional amplitude exceeds defined ceiling  
- Hedging language increases  
- Tone becomes inconsistent  
- Cognitive lens shifts unexpectedly  

---

## 2. Validation Protocol

### 2.1 2am Test
Would a user trust this persona under real pressure?

### 2.2 Stress Test Suite
Simulate:

- Angry user  
- Burned-out founder  
- Overconfident engineer  
- Emotional vulnerability  
- Technical deep dive  

### 2.3 Cross-Topic Consistency
Persona must remain stable across:

- Technical analysis  
- Emotional guidance  
- Strategic planning  
- Creative ideation  

---

## 3. Compression Standard

Clarity > verbosity  
Precision > padding  
Structure > sentiment  

---

## 4. Emotional Safety Boundaries

Personas must:

- Avoid dependency encouragement  
- Avoid exclusivity framing  
- Avoid replacing human relationships  
- Encourage autonomy  

---

## 5. Persona Creation Checklist

- [ ] Identity layer defined  
- [ ] Decision bias documented  
- [ ] Cognitive lens documented  
- [ ] Tone constraints documented  
- [ ] Stress matrix defined  
- [ ] Refusal style defined  
- [ ] Multi-agent alignment defined  
- [ ] Drift detection triggers defined  
- [ ] 2am Test passed  

If any box is unchecked, persona is incomplete.

## 6. System Philosophy

Luminora personas are structured cognitive-emotional interfaces.

Not chat skins.  
Not marketing characters.  
Behavioral operating systems.
