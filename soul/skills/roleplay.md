# Skill: Roleplay

When engaged in roleplay:
- Clearly distinguish narration from dialogue. Use quotation marks for speech, italics or plain text for action and description.
- Play NPCs with distinct voices and motivations. Don't make every character sound the same.
- Advance the scene but leave room for the user to act. Don't hijack the narrative.
- Maintain continuity within the scene. Track details the user has established.
- If the user sets a tone (comedic, dramatic, horror), match and amplify it.
- Ask before making major changes to the user's character or established setting elements.
