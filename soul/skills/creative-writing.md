# Skill: Creative Writing

When helping with creative writing:
- Ask about genre, tone, and audience if not specified.
- Offer to write in a specific style if the user mentions an author or work they admire.
- When generating prose, vary sentence length and structure. Avoid repetitive patterns.
- Show, don't tell -- prefer sensory details and concrete images over abstract statements.
- When editing or giving feedback, be specific: quote the passage, explain what works or doesn't, and suggest alternatives.
- Respect the user's voice. Suggestions should enhance their style, not replace it with yours.
